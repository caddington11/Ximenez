DH Elective Project Evaluation
https://caddington11.github.io/Ximenez/

As agreed upon in our DH Elective Agreement, I completed an English translation of a Spanish text between 3,750 and 5,000 words (Escolios a las historias de el origen de los indios), encoded the translation according to TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) standards, and published the translation online.

The project timeline reveals the final product’s major weakness, which was insufficient time allocated for troubleshooting and consulting with experts. I left the most difficult task—migrating the edition to independent hosting—to the end, and as a result, I had to attempt it on my own. While the source files testify to the many hours of intense effort dedicated to creating a painstaking TEI transcription, translation, and notes, as well as identifying the correct tool and template for the job, ultimately the project fell short of the published edition that I had hoped to produce.

That said, this elective project was extremely valuable in both personal and professional terms. Personally, I learned a hard lesson about project design, time management, and the pitfalls of attempting to go it alone. Professionally, I expanded my TEI skills, gained familiarity with a variety of TEI visualization tools, profoundly improved my understanding of this text, and laid the intellectual, critical, and bibliographical groundwork for my first dissertation chapter.



While the project’s DH value is limited in terms of its contribution to the field until fully realized, its value for my own DH progress has

Project design: settle on three-layer format (diplomatic transcription, annotated English translation, facsimile). Revise TEI of transcription layer, locate facsimile files, begin TEI of translation layer.

Week of April 14: Finish TEI of translation layer. Failed attempt to publish TEI using Edition Visualization Technology (http://evt.labcd.unipi.it).

Week of April 21: Redo TEI of translation layer to fit transcription, translation, and notes all in one XML file. Successful attempt to test publication using TEI Publisher (http://teipublisher.com). Failed attempt to host publication on independent domain.

Week of April 28: Write 1-page evaluation of project’s process and methodology, the DH value of the project, and the project timeline. Pushed work-in-progress files to GitHub.
